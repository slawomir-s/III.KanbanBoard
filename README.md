# III.KanbanBoard

The kanban board project is one of many project management techniques. In this way I created my own little Trello. The three main objects are board, column and card.

Functions:
    - add and delete column
    - add and delete card
    - move card within one column
    - move card to other column and save position and after refresh card is in the right place

Used:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - RWD
    - JS, jQuery
    - Grunt, Git
